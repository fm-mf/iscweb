Hi {{ $exchangeStudent->person->first_name }},

your arrival is approaching (or you have already arrived) and even though we try to do our best,
unfortunately, we can not find a Buddy for every exchange student. Buddy program is a voluntary
service and the number of exchange students coming every semester is very high.
We keep you in the Buddy database so someone can still become your Buddy.

Our Survival Guide ({{ route('guide') }})
on our web site gives you all the information and dates needed for the first days of your stay in Prague.

Welcome Packs ({{ route('guide-page', ['page' => 'welcome-pack']) }})
are prepared for you in our ISC Point (https://goo.gl/maps/MrjEDKdCTUm)
at Masarykova dormitory – it is very useful because it includes a confirmation of study
(needed for student discount in Prague public transport), info about registration
at your new faculty, orientation week etc. Be sure to pick it up.
The Welcome Pack is waiting for you at Masarykova dormitory, room R304, 3rd floor (ISC Point).
Check our website({{ route('web.contacts') }}) for opening hours.

What do you need to do after your arrival:
 1. Do not change money at the airport. It is not favourable. As much as we know,
    the best exchange agency is eXchange (https://goo.gl/maps/buXiGkPoo3q) near Staroměstské náměstí
    with a coupon for even better exchange rate available here: https://www.exchange.cz/kupon.

 2. How to get from the airport to Dejvice (where main CTU campus and Masarykova dormitory is):
     • You can find a little shop with a big sign ‘Public Transport’ at both terminals.
        Go there and buy a 90-minute ticket. It is valid for 90 minutes since you validate it on the bus.
        That is enough for your way.
     • Another option is to buy the ticket from a ticket machine at the airport terminal or at the bus stop.
        The ticket machines accepts credit/debit cards.
     • You can also buy the ticket in the ‘PID Lítačka’ app (https://app.pidlitacka.cz) on your phone
        (available for Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.dpp.praguepublictransport&hl=en)
        and iOS (https://itunes.apple.com/cz/app/pid-litacka/id983071129))
        – install the app, register a new account, buy the ticket with a credit/debit card,
        activate ticket before you get in the bus. You need a working internet connection for this though.
     • Find a stop of bus No. 119 (in front of both terminals). When you enter the bus,
        don’t forget to validate the ticket in a yellow validation box inside the bus.
     • Go to the terminal station ‘Nádraží Veleslavín’ and change to the metro line A (green)
        in the direction of ‘Depo Hostivař’. Go to the station ‘Dejvická’.

 3. Go to the Masarykova dormitory (https://goo.gl/maps/uAb8pHV6kkWvjSXDA) to the 3rd floor to ISC Point and get:
     • Welcome pack ({{ route('guide-page', ['page' => 'welcome-pack']) }})
        ISC membership ({{ route('guide-page', ['page' => 'isc-intro#membership']) }}) (optional) with ESNcard & SIM card & T-shirt

 4. Go to the metro station Hradčanská or Nádraží Veleslavín and get:
     • 1-month or 3-months student public transport pass (don’t forget
        the confirmation of study from your Welcome Pack
        and a passport-sized photo (35×45 mm))

 5. Go to the CTU Identity Publishing House (VIC) (https://ist.cvut.cz/en/our-services/ctu-student-cards/) and get:
     • University ID card ({{ route('guide-page', ['page' => 'cards']) }}) and
        Login for the Study information system – KOS ({{ route('guide-page', ['page' => 'kos']) }})
        (check since when it is possible to get those in the printed Survival Guide form the Welcome pack)
