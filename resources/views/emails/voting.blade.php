    <p>Our lovely foreigners,</p>
    <p><b> join us for the last party of the semester ;-).</b><br>
        It won't be a normal inteGREAT party that you're used to. It will be a BOAT party with DJ, food, welcome drinks and crazy people like you.</p>

    <p>You need a costume for this party, of course. It will be a really special costume that you have to make each on your own...<br /> What is it? A white T-shirt! All of you will get a marker when boarding and you can let your art spirit loose. ;)<br /> <br /> Tickets is available in the ISC point from 28. 4. 2017 for 300,- so go there as quickly as you can.</p>
