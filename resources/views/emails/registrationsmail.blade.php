    <title>ISC CTU in Prague Buddy Program</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Hi there!<br>It's less than a month to your arrivals and we're doing our best to set up the <b>Buddy program</b> for you! We would very much appreciate your input now. Our goal is to find a buddy for every one of you. But since all buddies are volunteers, we can't promise anything. What will help, however, is if you fill out the following form:</p>

<p><a href="http://isc.cvut.cz/muj-buddy/register/update-exchange-profile/{$hash}">http://isc.cvut.cz/muj-buddy/register/update-exchange-profile/{$hash}</a></p>

<p><b>Please, keep the link for future updates of your arrival information.</b></p>
<p>The information you share will be visible to Czech buddies, so that it would be easier for them to choose based on the <b>date of your arrival</b> and things you might have in common. Exchange students, who submit the form, will be given <b>priority in the program</b>. So go ahead! You can fill information about your <b>hobbies</b>, about your <b>field of study</b> and even about the reason of choosing Prague as your exchange destination. :)</p>
<p>Please, keep in mind that this information is relevant for Czech buddies, especially the date of your arrival. If you donÂ´t know the date yet, you can still update it later! We recommend you to take your time and fill the form patiently and into details.</p>
<p>If, for any reason, you don't wish to have a Czech buddy, you can also take your name out of the program by checking the "I don't wish to have a buddy" option in the same form. Just remember that taking part in the Buddy program is the best way to meet Czech people, learn something about us and our culture and, above all, it can make your first days in Prague significantly easier, since not all people in Prague speak English.</p>

<p>You can find more information about the International Student Club and our activities on our website <a href="https://www.isc.cvut.cz">www.isc.cvut.cz</a>. And if you have any questions, feel free to ask at <a href="mailto:buddy@isc.cvut.cz">buddy@isc.cvut.cz</a></p>

<p>We can't wait to meet you in Prague.<br>Volunteers of International Student Club CTU in Prague</p>
