<p>Hi there,<br>
    we hope you're looking forward to your study abroad in Prague! We'll soon be closing the registrations
    to the Buddy Program and since you haven't filled out our registration form, we just wanted to remind you that you have last few days to do it.</p>

<p>So if you want to take advantage of having a Czech buddy who can make your first days in Prague significantly easier, hurry up! Just click
    on the following link and fill in the date of your arrival (all fields in the form are optional).</p>

<p>You can also take your name out of the program by checking the "I don't wish to have a buddy". Just keep in mind that taking part in the Buddy Program is
    the best way to meet Czech people and learn something about us and our culture.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you soon in Prague.<br>
