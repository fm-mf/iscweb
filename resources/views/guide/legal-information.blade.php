                countries of the  European  Union,  Norway,  Switzerland,
                Liechtenstein and Iceland.</p>
            If your country is not among these, find out if you need a visa before entering
            the Czech Republic (Shengen area). Check the <a href="http://www.mvcr.cz" target="_blank">www.mvcr.cz</a> website, under the
            Immigration tab, you can find lists of countries
            that are required to obtain a visa before entering

        <div class="col-lg-12"><p>The Schengen area includes the Czech Republic
                and most of the EU member countries in continental Europe, and also some non-EU member
                countries. The borders between Schengen countries are now open, and citizens of EU member
                countries  can  travel  easily  from  country  to  country. If you are able to obtain a Schengen visa,
                you will also be able to travel easily to the other
                Schengen countries. However, Czech consulates
                normally  issue  non-Schengen  visas  to  non-EU
                students. If you have a Czech non-Schengen visa,
                you are required to obtain a visa to visit other European countries.</p>

                get your visa sorted out well in advance.</p><p>
