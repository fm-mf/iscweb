        <div class="col-md-12 bg-danger">It is strongly recommended to attend the Orientation Week, which is held in the last
            week before classes start. During this week, international students are introduced to
            the CTU educational system and are given information for their stay in the Czech Republic. They are helped to register for their courses, they meet Czech and international
            students, make some trips, and generally settle in before the semester begins. Do not
            miss this good opportunity.
