        <div class="col-lg-12"><p>The  International  Student  Club  (ISC)  at  CTU
                was established in 1999 as a club of the Student
                Union. In 2003 it joined the Erasmus Student Network. Our close cooperation with the CTU International  Office  has  enabled  rapid  improvement of the overall international relations at our university.</p>
            <p>ISC at CTU promotes the highest standard of cultural awareness and international spirit in order
                to serve the needs of the modern community of
                students in the 21st century, thereby contributing to a better quality of education world-wide
                through  creating  a  unique  partnership  among
                university  students  and  sustaining  the  mutual
                understanding of our cultural differences.
