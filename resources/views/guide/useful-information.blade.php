        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>As  part  of  the  application  procedure,  Erasmus
                and Exchange students are required to submit a
                Learning Agreement for approval several months
                before arriving in Prague. You select the classes
                from the PROSPECTUS catalogue: the catalogue
                of Courses Taught in Foreign Languages can be
                found <a href="http://intranet.cvut.cz/incomers/erasmus-exchange/prospectus" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Deadlines can be found <a href="http://www.cvut.cz/incomers/erasmus-exchange" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>During Orientation Week you will meet with
                your study department and arrange the details of
                your schedule of classes. (Private students contact their Faculty coordinator.)</p>

        <h3>Credit system</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12">
            Study programmes are organised in a credit system, in which each course is assigned a certain
            number of credits depending on the scope and
            difficulty of the course. The credit system at CTU
            in Prague is compatible with the European Credit
            Transfer System (ECTS). Note that CTU awards
            credits but your home university must recognise
            them.  Your  duly  agreed  Learning  Agreement,
            signed before the semester by both universities,
            should  ensure  your  right  to  full  recognition  of
            courses  on  your  Learning  Agreement  that  you
            pass.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>Make sure that you take plenty of physical exercise while you are in Prague! ISC organises a wide
                range of opportunities to take part in recreational sport and keep physically active, and collaborates  with  the  university’s  Institute  of  Physical Education and Sport. The Institute offers a special welcome for international students, and has
                very good web pages in English explaining how
                you can use the very wide range of facilities that
                it administers and courses that it offers. <a href="http://utvs.cvut.cz/en/" target="_blank">utvs.cvut.cz/en</a>.</p>
            <p>There are fitness and sports facilities in several of the dormitories that are accessible for you.
                Commercial  climbing  walls,  swimming  pools,
                ten-pin bowling alleys and many other physical
                activities are widely available.</p>
            <p>Students  who  want  to  join  sports  clubs
                and train and play competitively are advised to
                contact the Institute of Physical Education and
                Sport, or ISC, or a sports club, before you arrive in
                Prague, or very soon after your arrival. The Czech
                Republic and CTU in Prague have a strong sporting tradition.</p>
            <p>A  word  of  warning:  if  your  Czech  friends
                say “Shall we go for a walk on Sunday!” find out
                whether they intend 15 kilometres or 30 kilometres.</p>

            <p>In all faculties of CTU students can use plentiful
                computer  facilities  with  access  to  the  university’s  computer  networks  and  consequently  to
                information throughout the world. Many open
                spaces are equipped with WiFi, so that students
                with their own laptop can have unlimited access
                to  www.  All  university  dormitories  have  high-speed internet  access.  Each  faculty  has  its own
                computer labs. In order to get access you need to
                have a CTU e-mail account at your own department. This is done during course registration in
