                Prague’s integrated public transportation network fully covers the city, including the airport.
                The downtown is interconnected by three metro lines, A (green), B (yellow), and C (red). The
                metro operates daily from 5 am to midnight and runs every 2 to 10 minutes. The tram system
                includes daytime operations from 4.30 am until after midnight, and the night system operates
                from midnight to 4.30 am (night trams are denoted by a double digit number starting with 5).
                Buses run mostly outside the downtown area. Local trains are also included in the system.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12">You  can  buy  tickets  from  yellow  coin-operated
            machines at metro/tram/bus stations and stops.
            Once you have your ticket, punch it in the little
            yellow franking machine before you go down to
            the metro or as you get on the bus or tram. The
            ticket is valid from the moment it is punched.

                Always insist on getting a receipt. If you have
                left your valid pass at home, you pay a CZK 50
                fine at Prague 2, Na Bojišti 5 (Metro Line C – I.
                P. Pavlova station) from the next day (12.30 pm)
