    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12"><p>Rooms in the dormitories are inexpensive, conveniently located and all have high-speed internet
                access. However, you will share a room – single
                rooms are usually not available, and cannot be
                arranged by the international office.
            </p>
            <p>Some  of  the  dormitories  have  small  rooms,
                and offer only a moderate level of comfort. The
                allocation of rooms in dormitories is not the responsibility of the international office, but of an
                organization  called  SÚZ  (Service  Facilities  Administration). Higher quality accommodation is
                available, at a price, on the open market. Private
                accommodation  is  currently  available  at  lower
                prices than in west European capital cities.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12"><p>You must follow the dorm regulations, otherwise
                you  risk  serious  disciplinary  measures  that  can lead to exclusion from the dormitory!!! </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Observe silence between 10pm and 6am</li>
                <li>Do not use the FIRE EXTINGUISHER, except in an emergency</li>
                <li>Do not smoke in the dorm</li>
                <li>If you have a party do not do leave any mess
                    in the communal areas, and OBSERVE THE RULES ON SILENCE!!!</li>
                <li>If you have personal visits, they must be
                    written down in the Visitors Book, which is normally at the reception desk</li>
            </ul>
            The International Office will not appeal against
            the decision to exclude students from the dormitory for major or persistent infringements against
            the dorm regulations. It takes the view that dormitory residents should be protected from students who behave without due respect for other
            residents.
