    <h1>Culture shock</h1>
    <p>Most likely, you will experience some level of culture shock. After all, it is normal
        to miss the comforts and familiarity of home in the course of one of your first extended
        stays abroad. If you are getting low, do seek help. The International Office and
        the International Student Club offer a sympathetic ear &ndash; talking it out at length,
        with a &quot;native&quot;, can be very therapeutic.</p>

    <p>We have a FB group that's here to help you: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/622379741533482/">How to Live Abroad</a>.
