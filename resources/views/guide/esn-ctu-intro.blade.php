{{--        TODO say something about ISC and renaming--}}
        <p>The Erasmus Student Network (ESN) at CTU in Prague was established in 1999.
            Our close cooperation with the CTU International Office has enabled rapid improvement
            of the overall international relations at our university.
            ESN at CTU promotes the highest standard of cultural awareness
            and international spirit in order to serve the needs of the modern community of students
            in the 21st century, thereby contributing to a better quality of education world-wide
            through creating a unique partnership among university students
            and sustaining the mutual understanding of our cultural differences.</p>

        <p><strong>Since 2003, {{ $fullName }} is a proud member of ESN Czech Republic.</strong></p>
