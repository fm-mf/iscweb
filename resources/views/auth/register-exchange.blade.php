        As an exchange student
        <strong>you do not have to register to the Buddy programme.</strong>
        We will contact you about two months before start of your exchange
        with instructions how to apply for a Buddy.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are an exchange student, your exchange starts in less than two months,
        and you still have not received any e-mails from us, then contact us at
