            <p>
                In the Buddy programme you can access some personal data about incoming exchange students.
                You have to protect this information and treat it in accordance with the law.
                There are few rules that apply to accessing and processing the data:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>it is necessary to prevent unauthorised persons from accessing personal data and the means for their processing, i.e. the Buddy programme system,</li>
                <li>it is necessary to prevent unauthorised reading, creation, copying, transfer, modification or deletion of records containing personal data from the Buddy programme,</li>
                <li>it is necessary to prevent the misuse of records containing personal data from the Buddy programme,</li>
                <li>it is necessary to prevent the use of records containing personal data for purposes other than those used by the Buddy programme.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These rules also apply to all data obtained from the Buddy programme.
                Similar rules apply to other ESN systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                By clicking on the ‘I understand and agree’ button, you agree to abide by these rules.
                This is not revolutionary, but it is better to clarify it. If you do not agree and refuse,
                your access to the Buddy programme will be restricted.
            </p>
